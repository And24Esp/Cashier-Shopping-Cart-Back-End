Jerry's Quick Mart technical exercise.

Jerry’s Quick Mart in Orlando, FL is having its grand opening in 3 days. His previously hired
software team lost all their files, and Jerry needs a solution for his grand opening.
Jerry has hired you for a quick solution to his problem. For the day of the Grand Opening, he
has put out marketing noting that all transactions must be in cash.
The basic functionalities that he needs for his grand opening are the following:

● Select whether customer is a Rewards Member or Regular customer
● Add items to cart
● Remove individual items from cart, with empty cart option
● View cart (including totals)
● Checkout and Print receipt
● Cancel Transaction

Inventory is passed into the application in a text file, with item information on each line. The
receipt is printed as a .txt file, with the transaction number and date included in the file name.
Inventory is updated after checkout to avoid customers buying items that are out of stock.

This repository contains the exercice's code, as well as an explanation about the solution and the deployment process.
